3.Semester Mail notification system
We've built an application that detects when you get physical post in your mailbox. When you've received mail it automatically sends you an email with a notification.
In the app which is built for mobile usage you can see the latest delivery with time stamp. The message shown changes depending on how many times you've gotten post.
The app automatically updates when you empty your mailbox as well, saying there's no new mail.
